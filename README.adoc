= JTE Spring Boot Starter

> https://jte.gg/[jte] is a secure and lightweight template engine for Java and Kotlin.
> All jte templates are compiled to Java class files, meaning jte adds essentially zero overhead to your application.
> jte is designed to introduce as few new keywords as possible and builds upon existing Java features, so that it is very easy to reason about what a template does.
> The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14521-jte[IntelliJ plugin] offers full completion and refactoring support for Java parts as well as for jte keywords.
> Supports Java 8 or higher.
